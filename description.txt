Significant disparities exist between the UX design and UI development between my demo version and the initial project codebase I received.

I commenced work on this codebase with a hint of skepticism.

The routing system lacked routing modules.
The layout page lacked clarity, and modularity between layout, pages, and components appeared improvable.

Nevertheless, I initiated the UI development, following the guidelines outlined in the project documentation available at this web link: https://showcase.thecyrano.app/.

The development experience was less than pleasant. After making minimal progress and realizing that the documentation might not be ready, and components might still be in progress, I encountered difficulties implementing the input field styling.

This prompted me to question why I was building components from UX designs (https://www.figma.com/file/gF1aF4Y4HdI9pRFxzLm8ny/Toastr?type=design&node-id=2-784&mode=design) that I did not find visually appealing, using documentation that was not user-friendly.

Upon this realization, I decided to suggest the adoption of a standard UI library widely used by the developer community. Consequently, I replaced the old theme with PrimeNG: PrimeNG Installation.

PrimeNG, an open-source UI library rich in components, offered a preferable alternative to building in-house components, as is the practice in Next-Sapien. It provided a pre-existing solution that is highly customizable.

PrimeNG (https://primeng.org/installation) was incorporated into this solution due to its extensive components and full compatibility with Angular mechanisms, such as 2-way binding. PrimeNG also supports Tailwind, which is widely adopted in front-end development community for fast UI development.

There is no need to reinvent the wheel.

Subsequently, I enhanced the project by adopting a superior UI library and restructuring the routing system. Now, each route is logically connected to the module, and I introduced a main layout as a module.

Finally, I began constructing a beautiful UI inspired by the documentation but infused with my own UX ideas.

I firmly believe my solution surpasses the one initially provided, as it accelerates development speed and, consequently, reduces development costs.

This project serves as a testament to my coding assessment.

The current solution lacks services and API calls, which are integral to back-end development.

Additionally, there is a deficiency in input validation. I am willing to address this further, for instance, by implementing an error state for the email input.

Setting up the project, integrating PrimeNG, resolving issues, and ultimately constructing a pleasing UI required a considerable investment of time. However, I am confident that the long-term benefits justify the initial time expenditure.

I am ready for further evaluation, but I also have to express my obligation of further communication and evaluation between other parties.

I am happily awaiting your response and look forward to connecting with the team on a video call to introduce myself, and get to know the team and business.
